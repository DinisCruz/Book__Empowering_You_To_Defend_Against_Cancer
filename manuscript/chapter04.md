# Unhealthy Lifestyle + Trigger = Cancer

Deb's cancer trigger came from a sclerotherapy vein treatment that injured her leg, as well as leaving a possible carcinogenic solution in the broken vein, resulting in a bump which grew year after year. The bump was misdiagnosed for 3 years. The injury to her vein, combined with her vulnerable body chemistry, allowed a 4" sarcoma cancer tumor to grow in her leg.

With a successful leg surgery behind her, doctors said that her cancer 'was gone'. However, Deb's life continued to be stressful both personally and professionally. She went back to eating sugar to cope with the stress, didn't get much exercise, and pulled back from socializing. 8 months after the leg tumor was removed, the same sarcoma metastasized to her lungs.

**Notably, at the time, she was not a candidate for chemotherapy or radiation.**

Deb later learned that if she had followed a Lifestyle Medicine approach even half the time during her life, her body's chemistry would have been unwelcoming to cancer, her tumor suppressor genes might have remained intact, and her immune system could have destroyed cancer cells before they took hold.

## How Deb's Unhealthy Lifestyle Weakened Her Defenses

Deb's unhealthy lifestyle choices weakened and broke her body's core defense systems responsible for suppressing cancer. Here are the causes and the effects:

- **Lack of nutrition** → Depleted immunity, inflammation, DNA/gene & enzyme damage, acidic chemistry
- **Chronic stress** → Acidic chemistry, inflammation, DNA/gene & enzyme damage, canceled apoptosis
- **Intermittent alcohol use** → Acidic chemistry, inflammation, DNA/gene damage*  
  *The risk rises with frequency and amount consumed
- **Sugar addiction & Candida overgrowth** → DNA/gene & enzyme damage, inflammation, canceled apoptosis, acidic chemistry
- **Reduced positive social connections** → Acidic chemistry, indirect DNA/gene damage from stress
