## About the Author

**Deb Brewer** is a Stage 4 cancer survivor and Lifestyle Medicine practitioner who has successfully managed her cancer through lifestyle interventions. She holds certification in Nutritional Lifestyle Medicine from Harvard Medical School Executive Education and has combined her personal experience with research and training from preeminent homeopaths, naturopaths, and the American College of Lifestyle Medicine.

After her diagnosis and metastasis, Deb was not initially a candidate for chemotherapy or radiation. Through her dedicated application of lifestyle medicine principles, her lung nodules have remained stable or shrinking for 2 1/2 years, with no new growths, and her original cancer site has been clear for almost 6 years.

Deb created ReachVitality to share her knowledge and empower others facing cancer—or seeking to prevent it—by providing the tools and guidance needed to take control of their health and reach vitality.
