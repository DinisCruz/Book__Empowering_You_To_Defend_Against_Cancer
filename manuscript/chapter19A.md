##The Gut Microbiome##

Emerging research shows that the gut microbiome—the vast community of bacteria, fungi,
and other microorganisms in the digestive tract—plays a vital role in immune regulation,
inflammation control, and even how well cancer treatments work. For cancer patients, main-
taining a healthy microbiome through a diverse and brightly colored diet as well as prebiotics
(which feed beneficial bacteria) and probiotics (which replenish them) can strengthen
resilience, improve treatment tolerance, and support overall healing.

##Why the Gut Microbiome Matters for Cancer Patients:##

• Enhances immune function: A balanced microbiome improves communication between
gut bacteria and immune cells, boosting the body’s ability to detect and destroy
abnormal cells.

• Improves treatment response: Studies show patients with a diverse microbiome often
respond better to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

• Reduces inflammation: Healthy gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids (like
butyrate) that lower systemic inflammation linked to cancer growth.

• Supports nutrient absorption: Beneficial microbes aid digestion and help the body
absorb vitamins and minerals critical for recovery.

• Protects gut integrity: Prebiotics and probiotics help maintain the gut lining, preventing
“leaky gut,” infection risk, and toxin reabsorption during treatment.


##Probiotic Sources (Add Good Bacteria):##

• Supplements: Choose multi-strain probiotic capsules with at least 10–20 billion CFUs and
strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (we’ll show you these later in this module).

• Timing: Take probiotics with or right before meals to enhance survival through stomach
acid.


##Prebiotic Sources (Feed Good Bacteria):##

• Plant-based fibers: Garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, and artichokes.

• Resistant starches: Cooked and cooled yams and legumes provide fuel for beneficial gut
bacteria.

• Combination approach: Pair prebiotic foods with probiotic sources regularly to maintain
microbiome diversity and balance.

##In addition to an alkaline and multi-colored food diet, give
your body the targeted pre and probiotic support it needs to
prevent and fight cancer.##
