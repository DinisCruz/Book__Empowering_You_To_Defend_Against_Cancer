# Prevent, Fight, and Heal: A Lifestyle Medicine Program Tailored to Your DNA

Whether you're navigating a current cancer diagnosis or seeking to lower your risk, ReachVitality begins with you. We take time to understand your unique health history, lifestyle, and goals, then use this foundation to create a targeted Lifestyle Medicine program.

## Starting with Genetic Testing

A key starting point is often genetic saliva or tumor testing, which can:

- Identify inherited or acquired mutations influencing your body's defenses
- Reveal potential cancer risk factors
- Provide insight into how your body responds to stress, nutrition, and repair

## Armed with this information, ReachVitality crafts a program tailored to your body chemistry and personal needs, including:

- **Nutrition & Targeted Supplementation** → fueling cellular repair and resilience
- **Movement & Exercise** → strengthening immunity and improving balance
- **Restorative Sleep** → supporting repair and hormonal regulation
- **Stress Reduction** → lowering inflammation and protecting DNA
- **Positive Social Connections** → boosting immune health and well-being
- **Avoidance of Risky Substances** → reducing exposures that weaken defenses

This approach creates an internal environment less favorable to cancer while giving you greater confidence, peace of mind, and control over your health.

## Integration with Medical Treatment

The ReachVitality Program is rooted in Deb Brewer's personal and successful battle against Stage 4 cancer. The methods complement medical treatments, and we always encourage you to consult your physician or oncologist before beginning any program.
