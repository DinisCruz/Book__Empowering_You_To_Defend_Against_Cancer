# Alkalinity & Acidity: Understanding Your Body's pH

## What is pH?

pH stands for "potential of hydrogen" and reflects the oxygen/hydroxyl balance (OH-) that, working together, neutralize excess hydrogen in your cells. Too much hydrogen creates acidity. Low levels of hydrogen, through the oxygen/hydroxyl function, promote alkalinity.

Alkalinity is associated with oxygen-rich molecules, especially hydroxyl ions (OH-). These ions neutralize excess hydrogen, raising pH toward alkaline.

###The pH Scale

The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14:

- **7.0** is neutral
- **Below 6.4** is acidic (excess hydrogen)
- **Above 6.4 – 7.0** is alkaline (more oxygen/hydroxyl balance)

## How Does pH Affect Cancer?

Cancer cells thrive in lower-pH, acidic, low-oxygen environments, where acid fuels their rapid growth through supporting sugar fermentation (the Warburg effect). Acidity also weakens key immune defenders—especially T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells—as well as tumor-suppressor genes, all of which play vital roles in controlling and destroying cancer.

Conversely, high oxygen, or alkalinity, disrupts this process: When oxygen is plentiful, cancer cells can't lean on fermentation as easily, which slows and can stop their growth.

Additionally, plentiful oxygen/alkalinity strengthens normal cell metabolism and immune function (T-cells, NK cells, and tumor suppressor genes), giving the body a better chance to resist cancer progression.

## Blood pH vs. Urine pH

There are two indicators of pH levels in the human body: blood pH and urine pH.

### Blood pH

Your blood pH reflects how well your body stays balanced between acid and alkaline. It's normally kept within a very narrow, safe range of 7.35–7.45. Even small shifts outside this range can affect critical functions like enzymes, electrolytes, the heart, and the brain.

### Urine pH

Unlike blood pH, which is kept within a very tight range, urine pH changes more quickly and gives a real-time picture of the body's acid–alkaline balance. Because the kidneys regulate what acids and bases are excreted, urine pH reflects how your body is actively adjusting to maintain overall blood pH balance. In this way, urine pH can serve as a practical indicator of whether the body is leaning more acidic or alkaline at any given moment.

## Putting Alkalinity to Work at Fighting Cancer

### Lifestyle Choices Affect Alkalinity

The 6 Pillars of Lifestyle Medicine all work together to support your body's natural alkalinity. These habits improve oxygen delivery, strengthen cellular repair, and create an internal chemistry less favorable to cancer:

- Nutrition/supplementation
- Exercise/movement
- Restorative sleep
- Stress management
- Positive social connections, and
- Avoidance of risky substances

When the Pillars fall out of balance, the body can become more acidic, creating conditions cancer can exploit.
