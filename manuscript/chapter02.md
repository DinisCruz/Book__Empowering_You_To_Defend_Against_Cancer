# Our Core Defense Systems

Our bodies are equipped with powerful defense systems designed to prevent cancer. These systems work together to repair DNA/broken genes, control cell growth, and destroy abnormal cells before they can take hold. Cancer only develops when enough of these defenses are compromised or broken.

## A Healthy Body's Core Defense System

- **Tumor Suppressor Genes** – Act as gatekeepers and one of the most critical defenses, pausing cell division, repairing damage, or triggering cell death when a cell becomes too abnormal.
- **DNA Repair Enzymes** – Constantly scan for and fix DNA errors, preventing mutations from accumulating.
- **Apoptosis (Programmed Cell Death)** – A built-in "self-destruct" system that removes cells that are beyond repair.
- **Autophagy & Stress Responses** – Clear out damaged components in cells and respond to oxidative stress to keep cells healthy.
- **Immune System** – Natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and macrophages patrol the body, identifying and destroying cells that look abnormal or cancerous.
- **Whole Body Alkalinity** – Creating an internal environment that improves oxygenation, curbs cancer's ability to progress, and strengthens the body's natural defenses so cells can function optimally.

## How do these defense systems become compromised or broken?

- **Inherited, or Germline Mutations** – Some people are born with mutations in key tumor suppressor or DNA repair genes (like TP53 or BRCA1/2), which weakens defenses from the start.
- **Chronic, Unhealthy Lifestyle Choices** – Poor nutrition, smoking, alcohol use, inactivity, chronic stress, and lack of restorative sleep increase oxidative stress, create an acidic chemical environment, weaken and break DNA/gene tumor suppressors, and suppress immune, apoptosis, autophagy & stress defenses.
- **Somatic Mutations** – These mutations occur during a person's life from DNA/gene damage due to chronic unhealthy lifestyle choices and environmental toxins, and accumulate in specific cells, disrupting their ability to regulate growth.
- **Environmental Toxins** – Exposure to pollutants, radiation, chemicals, or carcinogens directly damages DNA/genes and overwhelms the body's repair pathways.
- **Hormonal Imbalances** – Excess estrogen, cortisol, or other hormone shifts can stimulate abnormal cell growth, create acidity, and suppress immune function.
- **Chronic Inflammation** – Long-term inflammation creates a chemical environment that creates acidity and damages DNA, and silences tumor suppressor genes.
