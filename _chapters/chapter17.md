# The Glycemic Index

## Understanding the Glycemic Index

The Glycemic (glucose, or sugar) Index ranks how quickly carbohydrate-containing foods raise blood sugar. Foods with higher scores cause faster blood sugar "spikes". Eating low glycemic foods is important because it helps starve cancer cells by limiting the rapid spikes in blood sugar they rely on for growth and energy (known as the Warburg effect).

The Glycemic Index includes a wide range of foods, and some of the higher score (high sugar) foods are:

- **Fruits**: watermelon, grapes, honeydew melon, raisins
- **Vegetables**: white potatoes, carrots, beets
- **Processed/refined foods**: white bread, sugary drinks, pastries, candy

## The Acidity Connection

When your body metabolizes large amounts of sugar, it can increase acidic byproducts (like lactic acid) and deplete alkalizing minerals (like magnesium and calcium) needed to buffer those acids. This can shift body chemistry toward acidity which is the environment cancer can thrive in.

It's important to know while some fruits and vegetables are high in GI, they also contain essential nutrients and fiber. ReachVitality recommends that all alkaline fruits and vegetables offer important nutrients and can all be consumed in moderation.

Low-Glycemic Index foods are digested slowly, helping to manage blood sugar and support steady energy— which is especially important for reducing inflammation.

## Sample High Glycemic Foods to Avoid

- White bread and refined grains (white rice, white flour, regular pasta, bakery goods)
- Sugary cereals (e.g., corn flakes, puffed rice)
- Instant oatmeal
- Pastries, cakes, bagels and cookies
- Soda and sugary beverages
- Candy and sweet snacks
- White potatoes (especially mashed or fried)
- Sugar sweetened yogurt
- Ice cream and frozen desserts
- Energy drinks and sports drinks
- Processed snack foods (e.g., crackers, tortilla and potato chips)

## Sample High Glycemic Foods to Eat in Moderation

- Carrots, Peas
- Artichoke, Radishes
- White potatoes
- Pumpkin, winter squash, yams, purple potatoes

## Sample Low Glycemic Foods Beneficial for Cancer Patients

- Spinach, kale, broccoli, zucchini
- Legumes (e.g., lentils, soy/tofu)
- Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, green apples, pears, cherries
- Avocados
- Celery
- Red cabbage
- Brussels sprouts
- Red onions
- Leeks, scallions
- Watercress
