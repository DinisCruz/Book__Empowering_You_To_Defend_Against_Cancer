# Deb's Journey to Healing

{class: success}
B> **Today, Deb's lung nodules are stable, and from time to time, shrink.**
B>
B> She's had no new lung nodule growths in 2 1/2 years, and the original site of cancer in her leg has been clear for almost 6 years.

## The 6-Pillar Lifestyle Medicine Approach

85% of the time, Deb follows a targeted 6-Pillar Lifestyle Medicine plan:

- Promoting balanced nutrition
- Targeted supplementation
- Reduced stress
- Restorative sleep
- Limited use of risky substances
- Exercise/movement
- Positive social connections

Deb has discovered a way to live in balance — one that has had a powerful effect on her cancer journey. She saves risky substances like alcohol, sugar, or processed foods for times of celebration with family and friends, making these moments joyful exceptions rather than daily habits. Most of the time, she focuses on healthy cooking, accountability through pH testing, and a Lifestyle Medicine routine that supports her body's natural defenses.

Her goal is to empower people facing cancer—or seeking to prevent it—by providing the knowledge and tools they need to take control of their health, and reach vitality.
