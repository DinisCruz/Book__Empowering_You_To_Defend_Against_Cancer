# An Important Note About Mutations

As we briefly discussed earlier, there are two kinds of genetic mutations.

- **Inherited or Germline Mutations** – Some people are born with mutations in key tumor suppressor or DNA repair genes (like TP53 or BRCA1/2), which weakens defenses from the start.
- **Somatic Mutations** – These mutations occur during a person's life from DNA/gene damage due to chronic unhealthy lifestyle choices and environmental toxins, and accumulate in specific cells, disrupting their ability to regulate growth.

Whether your cancer involves a germline mutation (inherited) or a somatic mutation (acquired during your lifetime), the ReachVitality 6 Pillars of Lifestyle Medicine Program is specifically designed to help cancer patients take back control of their health. While genetic changes may influence risk, lifestyle factors strongly affect how those genes express themselves — meaning you have the power to influence your body's internal environment and long-term outcomes.

Through this program, you'll learn practical strategies to mitigate cancer progression and reduce the likelihood of recurrence by supporting whole-body balance and repair.

## Through the program you'll discover how to:

- Nourish your body with anti-inflammatory, alkaline-supportive foods
- Improve oxygenation and circulation
- Strengthen immune function and cellular repair mechanisms
- Reduce oxidative stress and inflammation — key drivers of mutation activity
- Support restorative sleep and stress resilience to optimize healing
- Avoid environmental and lifestyle triggers that fuel disease
