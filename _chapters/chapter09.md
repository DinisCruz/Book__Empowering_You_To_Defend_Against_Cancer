# ReachVitality 6 Pillars of Lifestyle Medicine: Benefits At-A-Glance

## Supports Immune Function

Nutrient-dense foods and supplements enhance the immune system – supporting DNA/genetic repair and functioning so they can properly detect and destroy cancer cells.

## Promotes DNA/Genetic Repair

Reach Vitality supports DNA repair and genetic resilience, helping the body defend against cancer at its source.

## Reduces Inflammation

A diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods can help lower chronic inflammation, which is linked to cancer progression.

## Supports an Alkaline pH & Cancer Cell Death (Apoptosis)

Cancer thrives in an acidic environment. With higher oxygen levels, or an alkaline environment, oxygen disrupts cancer cells preferred low-oxygen, acidic metabolism (the Warburg effect), making it harder for them to grow and spread.

## Starves Cancer Cells

Limiting sugar and processed carbohydrates deprives cancer cells of their preferred and "easy to access" fuel — glucose (sugar circulating in your blood).

## Boosts Antioxidant Protection

Vitamins C, E, selenium, and plant-based antioxidants help neutralize harmful free radicals that can damage genes and DNA.

## Promotes Cancer Cell Death

Research shows that naturally occurring compounds in cruciferous vegetables produce compounds and phytochemicals that promote cancer cell death (apoptosis).

## Fills Nutritional Gaps

Fighting cancer, and cancer treatments, most often deplete essential nutrients. Supplements delivering electrolytes, B vitamins, vitamin D, zinc and magnesium can help ensure your body has the tools necessary to defend against cancer. People living with cancer have a higher metabolic load than those who are not living with cancer. Sitting still for a cancer patient is similar to someone without cancer walking at a brisk pace.

## Protects Healthy Cells During Treatment

Proper nutrition may reduce side effects from chemotherapy and radiation, help preserve energy, keep your immune system strong, and fuel healthy cells to remove damaged cells and promote healing.
