# Immune System Boosters

## Your Body CAN Kill Cancer Cells

### The Role of T Cells in the Immune System

Every day, your body naturally detects and destroys abnormal cells — including those with cancerous potential — through the immune system's constant surveillance. Specialized cells like natural killer (NK) cells and T-cells identify damaged or mutated cells and trigger their death, preventing them from multiplying. When your immune defenses are strong and balanced, your body is actively keeping cancer in check long before it can take hold.

T cells (lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell in the immune system. As they have the ability to kill cancer cells, they are a key component of the body's immune system in fighting cancer. Specifically, cytotoxic T cells (or killer T cells) are designed to recognize and destroy cancer cells.

One way to support cytotoxic T cell creation is by eating whole (not processed) foods that are high in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

## The Power of Whole Foods

These foods work synergistically to:

- Strengthen T-cell and NK cell function
- Reduce inflammation
- Support DNA repair
- Create an alkaline, oxygen-rich environment
- Provide essential vitamins and minerals
- Boost antioxidant protection

Remember, supplementation (covered in the next chapter) works alongside these nutritional strategies to fill gaps and provide targeted support that food alone may not deliver in sufficient quantities.
