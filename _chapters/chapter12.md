# Lifestyle Medicine Pillar 1: Nutrition & Supplementation

{class: success}
B> **Part 2: The Six Pillars of Lifestyle Medicine**
B>
B> In the following chapters, we'll explore each of the six pillars that form the foundation of the ReachVitality program. Each pillar works synergistically with the others to create an internal environment where cancer struggles to survive and your body can thrive.

## Introduction to Pillar 1

Nutrition and supplementation form the cornerstone of cancer prevention and treatment through lifestyle medicine. What you eat—and what you supplement—directly influences your body's ability to fight cancer, repair DNA, strengthen immunity, and maintain the alkaline environment that makes it difficult for cancer cells to thrive.

This pillar addresses the fundamental question: **How do we fuel the body's healing processes without feeding cancer?**

The answer lies in understanding that cancer patients face unique metabolic challenges. Your body isn't just fighting disease—it's working harder than ever to maintain basic functions, repair damaged tissues, and power an immune system under siege. Every nutritional choice either supports this heroic effort or undermines it.

## What You'll Learn in This Section

## The Foundation: It's About Balance

When facing cancer, every bite matters. The foods you choose can either fuel your body's increased metabolic needs—supporting immunity, cellular repair, and recovery—or feed cancer's demand for quick energy. By focusing on nutrient-dense, alkaline-balanced, antioxidant-rich foods and targeted supplements, you give your body the strength it needs to fight while creating conditions less favorable for cancer growth.

ReachVitality's Lifestyle Medicine Program will show you how to achieve homeostasis—the body's ability to maintain stable internal conditions like temperature, alkaline pH, and fluid balance. This isn't about giving up the things that make you happy. It's about creating a foundation of health that allows you to enjoy life while actively preventing and combating cancer.
