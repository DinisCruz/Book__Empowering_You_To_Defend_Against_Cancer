# Nutrition & Supplementation: Benefits At-A-Glance

## Supports Immune Function

Nutrient-dense foods and certain supplements enhance the immune system's ability to detect and destroy cancer cells.

## Reduces Inflammation

A diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods can help lower chronic inflammation, which is linked to cancer progression.

## Supports an Alkaline pH in Your Body

Alkaline foods and smart supplementation help supply the minerals and antioxidants your body needs to buffer acids, supporting a healthy alkaline pH.

## Starves Cancer Cells

Limiting sugar and processed carbohydrates deprives cancer cells of their preferred and "easy to access" fuel — glucose (sugar circulating in your blood).

## Boosts Antioxidant Protection

Vitamins C, E, selenium, and plant-based antioxidants help neutralize harmful free radicals that can damage DNA.

## Promotes Cancer Cell Death

Research shows that naturally occurring compounds in cruciferous vegetables produce compounds and phytochemicals that promote cancer cell apoptosis (programmed death).

## Fills Nutritional Gaps

Fighting cancer, and cancer treatments, most often deplete essential nutrients. Supplements delivering electrolytes, B vitamins, vitamin D, zinc and magnesium can help restore balance.

People living with cancer have a higher metabolic load than those who are not living with cancer. Sitting still for a cancer patient is similar to someone without cancer walking at a medium-fast pace. For cancer patients, it's especially important continually restore the body. It's essential for maintaining strength and ensuring it has the tools necessary to defend against cancer.

## Protects Healthy Cells During Treatment

Proper nutrition may reduce side effects from chemotherapy and radiation, help preserve energy, keep your immune system strong, and fuel healthy cells to remove damaged cells and promote healing.
