# Free Radicals, Antioxidants & Oxidative Stress

## The Delicate Balance

The body depends on a delicate balance between free radicals and antioxidants — when that balance is lost and free radicals overwhelm the body's defenses, oxidative stress occurs.

## What Are Free Radicals?

Free radicals are unstable molecules produced naturally through metabolism, stress, pollution, and certain medical treatments. In small amounts, free radicals help the body fight infection and respond to stress. But when their production exceeds the body's antioxidant defenses, they cause oxidative stress — an imbalance that damages cells, DNA, and tissues, leading to inflammation, weakened immunity, and a higher risk of cancer progression.

### Key Contributors to Oxidative Stress

The following create a free radical–antioxidant imbalance:

- Periods of chronic stress
- Poor diet
- Processed foods
  - They're often high in refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and chemical additives, all of which increase free radical production during digestion and metabolism
  - They typically lack natural antioxidants (like vitamins C and E, polyphenols, and enzymes) that protect cells from oxidative damage
- Intense exercise without recovery
- Toxin exposure (like pollution, pesticides, or smoking)
- Medical treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation

## How Antioxidants Work

Antioxidants work by donating electrons to neutralize free radicals, stopping their chain reaction of cellular damage and restoring balance to the body's internal environment.

To restore balance, it's essential to increase antioxidant intake through both whole foods and targeted supplementation. Foods rich in antioxidants — like berries, leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, green tea, turmeric, and vitamin C– or E–rich sources — help neutralize excess free radicals naturally. Supplementing with compounds such as chlorophyll can further strengthen the body's defense system, reducing oxidative stress and protecting healthy cells from damage.

## Food Sources Rich in Antioxidants

- Berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries)
- Leafy greens (spinach, kale)
- Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, Brussels sprouts)
- Green tea
- Turmeric
- Vitamin C-rich foods (citrus, bell peppers)
- Vitamin E-rich foods (avocados, olive oil)
