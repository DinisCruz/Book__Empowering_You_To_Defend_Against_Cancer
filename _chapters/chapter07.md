# Take The First Step & Take Back Control

All cancers share the same core breakdowns: gene mutations, tumor suppressor failure, repair errors, cell death avoidance, and immune evasion. The good news is that these shared pathways also highlight where you can strengthen your defenses and regain control.

## Introducing ReachVitality's Lifestyle Medicine Program for Preventing & Fighting Cancer

Lifestyle choices shape your body's susceptibility to chronic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Your first line of defense is how you live each day. Even if you've inherited a germline genetic mutation, such as BRCA1/2 or TP53, cancer is not inevitable. These mutations may raise risk, but research shows lifestyle strongly influences whether they ever get activated.

## When you focus on The 6 Pillars of Lifestyle Medicine:

- Nutrition & targeted supplementation
- Regular movement
- Restorative sleep
- Stress reduction
- Positive social connections, and
- Avoidance of risky substances

...you strengthen core breakdowns and promote DNA/mutation repair, support immune surveillance, apoptosis, and create an internal chemistry far less favorable to cancer growth.

## The Foundation of the Program

ReachVitality's Lifestyle Medicine Anti-Cancer Program is built upon:

- Deb Brewer's personal Stage 4 cancer experience including genetic testing and research at Mass General Brigham
- Deb's certification in Harvard Medical School's Executive Education Nutritional Lifestyle Medicine Program
- Research from the American College of Lifestyle Medicine
- Lifestyle medicine nutrition and supplement programming from Dr. Mark Mincolla, PhD

Each Lifestyle Medicine Pillar is designed to protect DNA, support mutation correction, promote alkalinity, strengthen immunity, and reduce toxins in the body — helping to correct core breakdowns and create the healthiest internal environment possible.
