# Create the Environment Where Cancer Cannot Thrive and DNA Can Heal

Your body has an incredible ability to heal when given the right conditions. The Reach Vitality Program is designed to help you build a strong foundation through oxygen-rich movement, nourishing alkaline foods, targeted anti-cancer supplements, restorative sleep, stress reduction, and cellular/genetic repair. By shifting from sugar-fueled energy to oxygen-powered vitality, you strengthen your immune system, support DNA repair, and create an internal environment that is unwelcoming to cancer.

## Next Steps

The next step is to dive into each of ReachVitality's 6 Pillars of Lifestyle Medicine. We have created a module for each Pillar that is easy to follow including research, purchase links, logs and much more.

## One-on-One Support

Deb is also available for one-on-one consultations to help develop an even more customized plan for your cancer, taking into account genetic mutations and other conditions that may impact your health. She can also support you with motivation, moderation, and ongoing encouragement — reminding you that you're not alone on this journey.
